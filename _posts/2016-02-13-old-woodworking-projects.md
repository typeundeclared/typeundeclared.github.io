This post aggregates some pictures and information about older woodworking projects.  Finished projects only; unfortunately, I don't really have in progress photos for many (sorry).

## Pedestal Table
My girlfriend's family member was getting married, and wanted a pedestal table as part of the ceremony to hold some items.  They liked it, but weren't able to take it back cross-country with them, so now it's a standing work table that my girlfriend uses a lot.

Table saw was used to cut the top perfectly round.

*Pine/fir, finished in boiled linseed oil and oil-based poly.*
