This post aggregates some pictures and information about older woodworking projects.  Finished projects only; unfortunately, I don't really have in progress photos for many (sorry).

## Pedestal Table
My girlfriend's family member was getting married, and wanted a pedestal table as part of the ceremony to hold some items.  They liked it, but weren't able to take it back cross-country with them, so now it's a standing work table that my girlfriend uses a lot.

Table saw was used to cut the top perfectly round.

## No-Sag Bookcases
Both of these were made of 2X lumber.  They can hold a full row of college textbooks without sagging.  Roughly based on the following [Low Bookshelf](http://www.woodgears.ca/shelves/low_bookshelf.html) build from woodgears.

*Fir, smaller in boiled linseed oil and oil-based poly, larger in water-based poly.*

## Valentine's Heart
*Pine, Poplar, Red Oak, Maple, Mahogany, oil-based finish*

## Picture Frames
Made with half-lap joints, rather than miters.  Sadly, the maple frame looks a lot more yellow in the picture than it actually is.

*Maple, Mahogany, danish oil finish*
