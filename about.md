## Blog Intentions
I'm an embedded software engineering by trade, and dabble in both woodworking and cooking on the side.  This blog (still early in its life) is intended to cover various thoughts on those matters.  *Potentially all in one post, but usually in separate posts*.

The tagline "{{ site.tagline }}" refers to an attitude I have with cooking: read up on recipes, understand what makes them work, but be willing to experiment (sometimes a lot).  I almost never make a recipe exactly as I find it in a book or on the internet.  Experimentation is what makes cooking fun.  And, I think that applies to other things, like software and woodworking, as well.

## Blog Technology
Since I'm using github pages and Jekyll to set up this blog, I'd like to note the various pages/projects that have helped smooth the initial setup (still very early... once I'm done with a setup, I'll probably move these links, plus some explanation, to a full post):
